# SWEN20003-Object-Oriented-Software-Development-Project-2

This was a game called "Shadow Quest" done during my time at the University of Melbourne (Semester 2, 2016). This version of the game has been
simplified in order to make sure submission of the game is stable. 

Controls:

Arrow keys to move. 

A to attack (the monsters).

T to talk (to the villagers).

The goal is to find the Elixir of Life and return it to Prince Aldric in order to save his father, the king.
